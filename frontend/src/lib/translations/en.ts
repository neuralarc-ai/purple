    description: "Most leading AI tools that businesses use across the globe operate on monthly subscription plans with limited tokens or credits, which often leads to underutilization or overages. Helium introduces an innovative pricing model designed for flexibility and cost efficiency. Businesses can choose a prepaid credit model, allowing them to purchase credits in advance and use them at their own pace, with the option to top up anytime. Alternatively, they can select the PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) model, which ensures they pay only for what they actually use. This approach can reduce overall AI spend for enterprises by as much as 45–55 percent, making Helium a highly economical and scalable solution for modern businesses."
