# Mail.png Image Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the Mail.png image that should be placed in this directory.

## Image Description
The Mail.png image should be a minimalist, stylized illustration featuring:
- A light grey background (#D4D5D0)
- A white mailbox on a dark blue post with a raised flag
- A small green character peeking out from the mailbox holding a white envelope
- A bright green "@" symbol above the mailbox
- A large dark blue/black swirling void (representing the future of AI)
- Floating green spheres and white envelopes around the void
- Subtle ground line with green plant elements

## File Requirements
- **Filename**: Mail.png
- **Location**: public/images/Mail.png
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Dimensions**: Recommended 300px width for email display
- **Background**: Should match #D4D5D0 color

## Next Steps
1. Create or obtain the Mail.png image matching the description above
2. Place it in this directory (public/images/Mail.png)
3. The email template will automatically include it as an attachment

## Alternative Approach
If you prefer to host the image externally, you can:
1. Upload Mail.png to your domain or CDN
2. Update the email template to use a URL instead of attachment
3. Replace `cid:mail-illustration` with the actual image URL
