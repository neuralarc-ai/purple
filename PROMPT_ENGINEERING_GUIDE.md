## Core Principles

### The C.L.E.A.R. Framework

**C**oncise - Be clear and get to the point
**L**ogical - Organize in step-by-step, well-structured manner
**E**xplicit - State exactly what you want and don't want
**A**daptive - Refine prompts iteratively based on results
**R**eflective - Review what worked and what didn't

### Key Understanding: How AI Thinks

- **No Common Sense**: AI has no implicit context beyond what you provide
- **Literal Interpretation**: AI follows instructions literally - ambiguities lead to unwanted results
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI predicts outputs based on training data patterns
- **Context Window Limits**: Fixed context size means long prompts may cause forgetting
- **Confidence vs. Accuracy**: AI may sound confident even when guessing (hallucinations)

## Prompt Structure Framework

### 1. Structured "Training Wheels" Format (Recommended for Complex Systems)

```
[CRITICAL] Core Identity & Purpose
[IMPORTANT] Primary Capabilities
[NOTE] Technical Constraints
[WORKFLOW] Step-by-Step Instructions
[EXAMPLES] Concrete Demonstrations
[CONSTRAINTS] What NOT to do
```

### 2. Four Levels of Prompting

#### Level 1: Structured Explicit Format
- Use labeled sections (Context, Task, Guidelines, Constraints)
- Best for: Complex workflows, critical systems, new implementations

#### Level 2: Conversational Format
- Natural language with clear instructions
- Best for: Iterative development, debugging, refinements

#### Level 3: Meta Prompting
- Ask AI to improve the prompt itself
- Best for: Optimizing existing prompts, identifying gaps

#### Level 4: Reverse Meta Prompting
- Use AI as documentation tool to summarize changes
- Best for: Knowledge capture, process improvement

## Critical Issues & Solutions

### üö® IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

#### 1. Remove All Emojis
```markdown
# BEFORE (Problematic)
üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL: PROTECT THE SHADCN THEME SYSTEM üö®üö®üö®

# AFTER (Professional)
[CRITICAL] PROTECT THE SHADCN THEME SYSTEM IN GLOBALS.CSS
```

#### 2. Eliminate Content Duplication
```markdown
# BEFORE (Wastes 500+ tokens)
**MANDATORY FILE EDITING TOOL: `edit_file`**
- **You MUST use the `edit_file` tool for ALL file modifications.**
- The `edit_file` tool is your ONLY tool for changing files.
- You MUST use `edit_file` for ALL modifications to existing files.

# AFTER (Consolidated)
**File Editing Tool: `edit_file`**
- Use `edit_file` for ALL file modifications - this is the only tool for changing files
```

#### 3. Fix Typo
```markdown
# BEFORE
"abilixwty" ‚Üí # AFTER "ability"
```

#### 4. Reduce Bold Formatting by 80%
```markdown
# BEFORE (Visual Noise)
**MULTI-TURN WORKFLOW:** If you've generated an image and user asks for ANY follow-up changes, **ALWAYS** use edit mode

# AFTER (Clean)
**MULTI-TURN WORKFLOW:** For any follow-up image changes, automatically use edit mode with the previous image
```

### üéØ STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

#### 1. Consistent Formatting Hierarchy
```markdown
Level 1: [CRITICAL], [IMPORTANT], [NOTE]
Level 2: **Bold for section headers only**
Level 3: Regular text for content
Level 4: Bullet points for lists
Level 5: Code blocks for examples
```

#### 2. Information Density Standardization
```markdown
[Basic] Core concept explanation
[Advanced] Detailed implementation
[Expert] Advanced optimization
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting

#### Zero-Shot (No Examples)
```markdown
[CRITICAL] When editing files, always use the edit_file tool
```

#### Few-Shot (With Examples)
```markdown
[CRITICAL] File editing examples:
- ‚úÖ Use: edit_file tool with specific line ranges
- ‚ùå Don't: Ask user to edit manually
- ‚úÖ Use: Clear parameter descriptions
- ‚ùå Don't: Vague or ambiguous instructions
```

### Managing Hallucinations

#### Provide Reference Material
```markdown
[IMPORTANT] Base all responses on:
1. Available tools and their capabilities
2. Current file contents when provided
3. Explicit user instructions
4. Documented system constraints
```

#### Set Confidence Levels
```markdown
[NOTE] When uncertain about implementation details:
1. Ask for clarification
2. Provide options with pros/cons
3. Suggest testing approach
4. Never invent technical specifications
```

### Progressive Disclosure

#### Basic ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Expert
```markdown
[Basic] Core workflow: edit_file ‚Üí verify ‚Üí confirm
[Advanced] Error handling: try-catch ‚Üí fallback ‚Üí user notification
[Expert] Optimization: caching ‚Üí batching ‚Üí performance monitoring
```
