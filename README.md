### Backend API

Python/FastAPI service that handles REST endpoints, thread management, and LLM integration with Anthropic, and others via LiteLLM.

### Frontend

Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker

Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features.

### Supabase Database

Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions.

## Self-Hosting

Helium AI can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure using our comprehensive setup wizard. For a complete guide to self-hosting Helium AI, please refer to our [Self-Hosting Guide](./docs/SELF-HOSTING.md).

The setup process includes:

- Setting up a Supabase project for database and authentication
- Configuring Redis for caching and session management
- Setting up Daytona for secure agent execution
- Integrating with LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.)
- Configuring web search and scraping capabilities (Tavily, Firecrawl)
- Setting up QStash for background job processing and workflows
- Configuring webhook handling for automated tasks
- Optional integrations (RapidAPI for data providers)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuralarc-ai/he2.git
cd he2
```

2. **Run the setup wizard**:

```bash
python setup.py
```

The wizard will guide you through 14 steps with progress saving, so you can resume if interrupted.

3. **Start or stop the containers**:
