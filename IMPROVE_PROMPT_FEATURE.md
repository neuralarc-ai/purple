# Improve Prompt Feature

## Overview
The "Improve Prompt" feature has been added to the chat input component to help users enhance their prompts for better LLM interaction. This feature analyzes the user's input and provides suggestions to make it more effective.

## Location
The feature is accessible through the Plus (+) dropdown menu in the chat input, next to the file attachment option.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interface
- **Button Location**: In the dropdown menu that appears when clicking the Plus (+) icon
- **Icon**: Sparkles icon with helium-blue color
- **Availability**: Only enabled when there's text in the input field

### 2. Prompt Analysis
The system analyzes prompts based on several criteria:

#### Improvements Applied:
- **Vague Prompts**: Expands single-word or very short prompts with context
- **Natural Language**: Restructures prompts to use conversational language
- **Context Addition**: Adds relevant context when missing
- **Complex Task Breakdown**: Helps structure complex multi-part requests
- **Specific Keywords**: Replaces generic terms with more specific language
- **Clarity & Conciseness**: Removes filler words and improves sentence structure

### 3. Best Practices Implemented
The feature follows these prompt engineering guidelines:

#### ✅ Use Natural Language
- Converts "Training plan." → "Write a training plan for the sales team for the launch of a brand new product."

#### ✅ Be Clear and Concise
- Converts "Marketing talking points." → "Give me 12 thoughtful questions to ask a Chief Marketing Officer on their strategy for 2024."

#### ✅ Provide Context
- Converts "Write about a sales job." → "Write a job description for a [job title], including the required skills and experience, as well as a summary of [company name] and the position."

#### ✅ Use Specific Keywords
- Converts "Create project plan." → "Create a project plan for the launch of a brand new product. The timeframe should be from now until June 2024."

#### ✅ Break Down Complex Tasks
- Identifies multi-part requests and suggests clearer structure

## User Experience

### Dialog Interface
1. **Original Prompt**: Shows the user's current input
2. **Improved Prompt**: Displays the enhanced version
3. **Improvements Made**: Lists specific enhancements applied as badges
4. **Actions**: 
   - Copy improved prompt to clipboard
   - Apply improvement (replaces original text)
   - Cancel (closes dialog)

### No Improvements Needed
If the prompt is already well-structured, the system displays a positive message indicating no improvements are necessary.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified:
1. `frontend/src/lib/prompt-improvement.ts` - Core improvement logic
2. `frontend/src/components/thread/chat-input/improve-prompt-dialog.tsx` - UI dialog component
3. `frontend/src/components/thread/chat-input/message-input.tsx` - Added button and integration

### Key Functions:
- `improvePrompt()` - Main analysis and improvement function
- `isVague()`, `hasContext()`, `isComplexTask()` - Analysis helpers
- `expandVaguePrompt()`, `addContext()`, `breakDownComplexTask()` - Improvement helpers

## Usage Examples

### Before Improvement:
```
"help"
"fix bug"
"create website"
"marketing plan"
```

### After Improvement:
```
"Help me with a specific task. Please provide detailed guidance on [please specify what you need help with]."

"Fix the following issue by identifying the problem and providing a solution for bug. Please analyze the issue, explain what's causing it, and provide a step-by-step solution."

"Create a website with the following features and requirements:. Please include the required functionality, best practices, and any necessary dependencies or setup instructions."

"Please help me with the following specific task: marketing plan. I need detailed guidance on how to accomplish this. Please provide detailed guidance with specific examples and best practices."
```
